# AI Context for Plotext

## What is this project?
A Python library for creating terminal-based charts and plots with enhanced visual styling through chuk-term integration.

## Key Technologies
- Python 3.10+
- Chuk-term (terminal enhancement)
- Rich (panel rendering)
- UV (package manager)
- Pytest (testing)

## Recent Changes
- Migrated to modern src-layout structure
- Added chuk-term integration for enhanced banners
- Created new object-oriented API alongside traditional API
- Implemented UV package management
- Added comprehensive example and test suites

## How to work with this codebase
1. Use `uv run` for all Python commands
2. Source code is in `src/plotext/`
3. Run examples with `uv run python examples/[filename].py`
4. Tests are in `tests/` directory
5. Maintain 100% backward compatibility

## Key Files
- `src/plotext/_core.py` - Original API (keep unchanged)
- `src/plotext/_api.py` - New modern API
- `src/plotext/_output.py` - Enhanced output system
- `pyproject.toml` - UV configuration
- `examples/` - Working code examples
- `llms.txt` - Comprehensive AI documentation

## Current Architecture
The codebase has two parallel APIs:
1. Traditional functional API (preserved for compatibility)  
2. Modern object-oriented API with chuk-term integration

Both APIs share the same underlying plotting engine but have different interfaces.
